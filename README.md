# HttPy

This is just a short Python code snippet for making HTTP requests.
This can be treated as either a reference for the built-in libraries
or you can just use this as-is. It is released as public domain. 
Copy the file or copy the code directly. It's up to you!

Most references online insist on installing pip libraries despite 
HTTP fetching being built-in functionality to python. If your small 
script does not already require using pip, that would be annoying.
